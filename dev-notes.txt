1. Results of both the VWAP and SMAP for Disney seem MUCH too high relative to the Benchmark. There may be some chronological bias going on
   Confirm that the set_value function is correct

2. Should probably show graph of return growth for the the buy/hold, VWAP, and SMAP strategy

3. What are the two plot graphs trying to communicate?

4. Why does the plot of the line on the second chart (strategy value vs. benchmark value) not seem to fit the data points

5. We should introduce and better explain what we hope to achieve by this analysis

6. start function with the "Disney" print out is fixed on 2010-01-04 even when the variable is changed...

7. Consider using backtrader or pyfolio packages to simplify calculations
