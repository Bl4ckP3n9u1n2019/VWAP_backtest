2. Should probably show graph of return growth for the the buy/hold, VWAP, and SMAP strategy

3. What are the two plot graphs trying to communicate?

4. Why does the plot of the line on the second chart (strategy value vs. benchmark value) not seem to fit the data points

5. We should introduce and better explain what we hope to achieve by this analysis

7. Consider using backtrader or pyfolio packages to simplify calculations

9. Error discovered in the set_singal function. Signal is being set the day of the intiation. It needs to be added to the
   next row and be calculated with delay

10. Results of SMAP and VWAP seem much too similar... I would expect VWAP to be much slower than the SMAP

11. Look into using the module Seaborn for histograms - https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/distributions.html

12. Need to identify large outlier created with the S&P 500 Data.
    I think this is being caused by a short timefram for the test. Need to write a script that will only capture stocks with data at least
    back to 2010 (or whenever start date is)
